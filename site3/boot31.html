                        <p>
                            Norway’s famous fjords are found throughout the country and not limited to a particular region or location. However, the most dramatic and famous fjords are largely found in West Norway, approximately from Stavanger to Molde. Although the western fjords vary slightly in appearance they are generally relatively narrow, surrounded by steep rock faces, tall mountains and extremely deep. The most famous fjords include Geirangerfjord and Nærøyfjord.

                        </h3><div></div>
                        <p>
                            Svalbard is a group of islands located between the Arctic Ocean, Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and the Norwegian Sea. The islands are under Norwegian rule since 1920. Its settlements are the northernmost permanently inhabited spots on the planet, far more northerly than any part of Alaska and all but a few of Canada’s Arctic islands. The combined permanent population is less than 3000, nearly all of which is concentrated in the main settlements of Longyearbyen and Barentsburg on Spitsbergen. Svalbard’s visitors come mostly to experience Arctic nature at its rawest and most powerful. The islands feature untouched glaciers and craggy mountains, but also amazing wildlife such as polar bears, caribou, reindeer, polar foxes, whales, seals and walruses.

                            Lofoten Islands 
                        </h3><div></div>
                        <p>
                           One of the most popular places to visit in Norway, Lofoten is a group of islands in the northern part of the country. With its postcard looking small fishing villages nestled in fjords, dotting a very rugged coast with abrupt peaks rising directly from the ocean, the archipelago is often described as one of the most scenic parts of Norway. Although the archipelago is located well above the Arctic Circle, at about the same latitude as Greenland it enjoys a relatively mild climate due to the circulation of the Gulf Stream. Temperatures up to 23°C in the summer are not uncommon although it remains a subarctic destination and the weather changes fast.

                        <p>
                            Jotunheimen, or Home of the Giants, is Norway’s premier national park. Located in the nation’s south central region, the park encompasses several mountain ranges, including Norway’s 29 highest peaks. The park is also home to Vettisfossen, which at 275 meters (900 feet) is the highest waterfall in Norway. Mountain lodges and well-marked trails in the area offer visitors easy access to glacier hikes, summit tours, mountain climbing and skiing. Tour companies and trekking associations offer outdoor adventures for visitors of every age and skill level.
