                        <p>
                            Just miles away from the more famous (and also very beautiful) Yellowstone National Park, you’ll find Grand Teton National Park. It encompasses the majority of the Teton Range and is named after the highest point, Grand Teton. This is a fascinating place for nature lovers, as the undisturbed ecosystem features hundreds of plants and animals that have been living there long before humans and are difficult to find elsewhere. It’s especially exciting for trout fishers, because it’s the only place you can fish for the Snake River fine-spotted cutthroat trout.

                            Haleakala National Park
                        </h3><div></div>
                        <p>
                            In the Hawaiian language, ‘haleakala’ means ‘house of the sun’, which is unsurprisingly a very fitting name for this park. There are two parts of the park – the summit of the Haleakala Volcano and the Kipahulu area at the coast. You can drive or hike up to the summit, where they have an observatory that will give you an amazing view of the almost otherworldly surrounding area. The element that most people come to see is the Haleakala Crater. You can hike through it, or even spend the night – they have three cabins that you can reserve.

                        <p>
                           Austin is a city of swimming holes, the most beautiful of which is undoubtedly Hamilton Pool. After about a quarter-mile hike through the forest, you’ll come to a natural pool created when the dome of an underground river collapsed into the water below. Now you can still see the overhang left by the dome, which still has a waterfall running over it. The water is clear, cold, and refreshing, and the different colors of the trees, moss, rocks, and sparkling water give the place a mystical quality.

                        <p>
                            Savannah, the oldest city in Georgia, is a rare find in the United States. With its cobblestone streets, leafy downtown, and streets lined with some of the oldest buildings in the country, it definitely deserves praise. The downtown area is one of the largest National Historic Landmark districts, and you can enjoy both easy access to the coast and the charming Savannah riverfront. Beyond just its physical beauty, Savannah is also known to be full of warm, hospitable people.
