                        <p>
                           There is perhaps no other bridge in the world that captures the imagination of so many people as San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. This bright red behemoth stretches across the Golden Gate strait, which separates the Pacific Ocean from the San Francisco Bay. Besides being very beautiful, it is also an impressive feat of engineering; the American Society of Civil Engineers even named it one of the Wonders of the Modern world. Keeping it so bright is no easy job – 38 painters are constantly employed just to touch up places that get corroded.

                        <p>
                            There is no better place to enjoy the windswept, pastel beauty of the eastern seaboard than North Carolina’s Outer Banks. They are a string of mostly barrier islands that border most of the North Carolina coast. Two notable historical events also happened on the Outer Banks, the better known of which was the Wright brothers’ first successful flight in the town of Kitty Hawk in 1903. The lesser known of the two was the birth of Virginia Dare, the first child of English descent born on the American continent. She was born at Roanoke Colony, the first English colony, in 1587. Most people don’t remember this colony, however, because it disappeared, leaving one of the greatest unsolved historical mysteries.

                        <p>
                           Millions of years of erosion have left fascinating geological structures across much of the American Southwest, although none are quite so impressive as the stone arches at Arches National Park. The rock is all sandstone, with its orange glow that looks so different depending on the light conditions in the area. The park is located in eastern Utah, outside of Moab. Environmental conditions are still taking their toll on the arches, though, and at least 43 have fallen since 1977. In order to limit the effects of humans, there are many arches that you can only view from far away.

                        <p>
                            South Dakota is often unfairly categorized as a flyover state; however, the Badlands alone make the state worth a visit. This national park has two very different looking parts: an expansive mixed grass prairie and a rock formation where different levels of erosion have carved out pointed spires and shallow canyons to reveal differently colored stripes of sandstone. It is also an area especially rich in fossils. Fossils of all sorts of prehistoric animals have been found there, telling the story of a past with a very different climate than it has now.
